<h3>Important Note from us at EdgePlus+: </h3>
<p>Edgenuity updated their dashboard on 9/15/22 which lead to a huge crash on everyone's end. It was fixed asap (within half an hour) and everyone of our affected users was assited and brought back on track. On 9/15/22, the brainly auto search feature for quizzes and tests was removed due to it being buggy and sorta useless. A new version of that feature was re-added to the script in version 1.9.7 on 9/16/22. The script is perfect as of now (all current bugs reported have been fixed). We are sorry you guys had to go through that stressful ordeal, but due to the good communication between users and script authors, we made it 💪. We highly encourage bug reports and feature requests so please send them to either the sedgenuity email or my insta down below. Speaking of <b>New Features</b>, Are you guys ready for the upcoming v2.0 of the script?? 🤩</p>
<br>
<h3>Description:</h3>
EdgyBot: A partially AFK Edgenuity Bot that works on 99% of assignments offered by Edgenuity. It does all non test/quizzes on course-line first (By itself) and leaves the rest for the user. For tests, pre-tests, quizzes, cumulative-exams, etc., it auto searches the questions on Brainly.com. If an answer is found it will automatically answer the question and move on to the next. The script comes with a Brainly Lockpick, which removes the brainly paywall and 1 answer per day limit, allowing users to view all brainly answers for free. The bot can be left to run on it's own, but it's recommended that you stay in the same room in case the bot has any issues. If the bot does run into an issue, it can be fixed with a simple refresh of the page. This script has only been tested on chrome, so for the time being, should only be used on chrome. It requires an extension from the chrome webstore in order to run on Edgenuity.

<h3>Key points:</h3>
<ul style="margin-bottom:10px;">
<li>When you leave the EdgyBot to do work by itself, you need to <b>stay on the same tab.</b> The bot will not work if you are on another tab. 🔴</li><br>
<li>Clicking <b>CTRL ALT B</b> on your computer keyboard let's you remove or add the classic EdgyBot wallpaper. 🌃</li><br>
<li>Clicking <b>CTRL ALT R</b> on your computer keyboard now resets your EdgyBot by removing the purchase key connected to the account along with saved classes and other settings. This is to fix any issues being faced on your end. If this doesn't fix the issue, contact sedgenuity@gmail.com.  🔴</li><br>
<li>Clicking <b>CTRL ALT C</b> on your computer keyboard let's you switch the class you set EdgyBot to do. 🔃</li><br>
<li>Quizzes, Tests, and any other heavily graded assignments will never be fully automated. We do not want our bot to mess up your grades in case it has a bug/issue, so for those sort of assignments, EdgyBot <b>only assists</b> but never does the work for you automatically, neither does it open them by itself. It requires a turn off of the bot via tampermonkey, opening the assignment, and turning back on of the bot in order for assistance. Your heavily graded assignments are completely safe. These assignments won't be automated in future updates unless we can guarantee a 90%+ on these assignments through automation. 🔒</li><br>
<li>When EdgyBot is doing work, it might look like it's going crazy but you have to trust it. Everything it does, it does for a reason. <b>Everything is Calculated</b> 🧠😵</li><br>
<li><b>Version 1.7 & Up</b> now automatically check for updates on the <a href="https://edgenuity-plus.web.app/">EdgePlus+</a> website, so users always have the latest personalized EdgyBot. 🤩 </li><br>
<li>EdgyBot will now ask you to pick a class for it to work on. When you want to switch a class click <b>CTRL ALT C</b> on your keyboard. 😉</li><br>
<li>The script comes with a Brainly Lockpick, which removes the brainly paywall and 1 answer per day limit, allowing users to view all brainly answers for free 🔐</li><br>
<li>It goes back to the course-line and continues doing non test tasks on it's own. 🧠</li><br>
<li>The bot can be left to run on it's own, but it's recommended that you stay in the same room in case the bot has any issues. 💁‍♂️</li><br>
<li>The script can answer many types of assignments by itself. ✍</li><br>
<li>It may answer a question wrong once in a blue moon, but that's only on non essential (not graded) assignments. 😴</li><br>
<li>While the user is manually taking a test, quiz, cumulative exam, etc.., it will automatically find the answer for the question on brainly, answer it, and move on to the next question if an answer is found. If not it will wait for the user to move on to the next question.  🔴🟢</li><br>
<li>Answers questions correctly 90% of the time. 🎯</li><br>
<li>Make sure to check for updates daily, either here on github or on the site <a href="https://edgenuity-plus.web.app/">EdgePlus➕</a></li><br>
<li>Sharing purchase keys might lead to technical difficulties on both persons ends. Please refrain from doing so. 🛑</li><br>
<li>This is still a work in progress, it's good and functional but it may still need some work. If you have any issues please contact me asap. 🙏</li><br>
<li>Once again, You can not hold me liable for your actions. This tool is for educational purposes only. You have been warned ‼ ⚠ </li><br>
</ul>
<h3>Reasons for script obfuscation: </h3>
<ol style="margin-bottom:10px;">
<li>If the script wasn't obfuscated, Edgenuity will easily be able to patch it due to the script utilizing an exploit found within their answer() function. 🙂</li><br>
<li>The script has a built in purchase verification system. If the script wasn't obfuscated people will easily be able to take credit for my work by removing the purchase verification functions and selling it as their own. 🥴</li><br>
</ol>
<h3>Common Problems: </h3>
<ul>
<li>You must allow popups if you want EdgyBot to automatically open brainly answers and return back to the page to auto answer (if an answer was found). </li><br>
<li>If the bot freezes on a question, a simple refresh of the page fixes it immediatly. 🔄</li><br>
<li>This script has only been tested on chrome, so for the time being, should only be used on chrome. 🤷‍♂️</li><br>
<li>The script won't work on a school computer  (unless TamperMonkey installation is allowed on chrome web store). 👎</li><br>
</ul>

<h3>Tips & Tricks: </h3>
<ul>
<li>To fix pretty much any bug, click <b>CTRL ALT R</b> and factory reset. Re-enter your purchase key and the problem should be gone. 👌</li><br>
<li>To take tests that the bot has skipped, turn off the script via tampermonkey, open the test/quiz and turn the bot back on. It will continue assiting u 👌</li><br>
<li>You can leave it on at night and it will have a lot of work done by the time you wake up 😴</li><br>
<li>If you have any issues that you would like resolved quickly, it's recommended you contact me via instagram. 🙂</li><br>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Reports & Statuses: (10)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bug found by treloots: Issue with purchase verification due to symbols being in the user's name. [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by treloots: Static url issue which prevented the bot from opening classes on it's own and resulted in edgenuity throwing (503) errors, essentialy taking away the bots AFK capabilities making it useless. [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by GSRHackZ: AFK task selection bug that would stop EdgyBot. [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by GSRHackZ: Class Picking feature implemented in v1.5 caused AFK to stop functioning. [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by GSRHackZ: Auto Update feature implemented in v1.7 caused AFK to stop functioning. [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by Ahmad: Bug affecting some users due to different placement of window.frames[index].AP
& FrameChain() leading to EdgyBot completely malfunctioning [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by Ricky: Bug affecting vocabulary assignments leading the bot to lose AFK & traps it in a location.reload() loop [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by Michael & GSRHackZ: Assignments are no longer fully afk. By assignments, We mean the ones that are the graded assignments with multiple choice questions, text box inputs and no videos. Anything with videos is still AFK, while the ones with only questions are not AFK but instead correct answers will be highlighted in blue by the bot. This is a fix for now until We have time to actually work on an AFK fix for assignments. [FIXED & CHANGED] 🕷🚩</li><br>
<li>Bug found by Ahmad & GSRHackZ: Bug affecting video watcher, leading to video loop causing EdgyBot to lose AFK until refresh. [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by GSRHackZ: Vocabulary assignment auto loop after completion bug which would make EdgyBot lose AFK until user manually exits [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
